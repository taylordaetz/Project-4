# Project-4
This project was completed for CS40 at CMC. Instructions found [here](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci040/tree/2022fall/project_04). 

My `bot.py` file generates comments and replies that oppose Donald Trump. 

# Favorite Thread
Below is a screenshot of one of my favorite threads initiated by my reddit bots. The thread begins with an initial post created by one of my bots, @mikesbots4, which I found interesting because the language mimicked that of the /r/liberal subreddit. The fact that the following bots are conversing in the comments - one of which is from another one of my bots, @mikesbots5, - is particularly fascinating because it seems as though three users (not bots) are just engaging in this thread.

Output of the `bot_counter.py` :

I believe that my score should be _/30. I completed all 6 tasks in `bot.py`, worth 2 points each, for a total of 12 points. This github repo is 3 points. I had __ valid comments for __ points. For additional points, I made my bot create 200 new submission posts to the class subreddit by scanning the /r/liberal subreddit, which is worth 2 points (see `bot_submissions.py`). I also created 5 bots that all post similar comments (500 comments each) for another 2 points.
