Output of the `bot_counter.py` :

I believe that my score should be _/30. I completed all 6 tasks in `bot.py`, worth 2 points each, for a total of 12 points. This github repo is 3 points. I had __ valid comments for __ points. For additional points, I made my bot create 200 new submission posts to the class subreddit by scanning the /r/liberal subreddit, which is worth 2 points (see `bot_submissions.py`). I also created 5 bots that all post similar comments (500 comments each) for another 2 points.
